# Source code for HTRU1-MSc project

Note that this example code has been set up to work with the [HTRU2 dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2) using BBB for a NN. For the project it will need to be adapted to use the MiraBest radio galaxy PyTorch dataset (`MiraBest.py`) and use BBB for a convolutional neural network (CNN).
